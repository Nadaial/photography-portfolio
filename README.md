# photography-portfolio
Photography-portfolio is a personal photography website that displays my work for potential clients. The current website include three pages, About, Portfolio,Contact. This is nhot thefinal version, I anticipate adding more features and content in the near future. Making the layout responsive to be displayed on devices of different sizes was the main factorin how this website is designed. 

## Installation
Pushed the code to github and created a unique public URL.

## Usage
Visit https://nadaial.github.io/photography-portfolio/ 

## Tests
The website was tested by three different users beside the developer on three different devices -two smart phones and a medium size tablet- and their feedback was taken into consideration when making adjustments:

*Carousels navigation buttons on the portfolio page were not functional-fixed
*Navbar link was not showing as active when the user is on the page-fixed
*Contact form fields were too narrow when displayed on a small device- padding and margins adjusted
